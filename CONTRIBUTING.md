For simple changes, and for users that aren't so confident with things like version control systems then just send your changes to `the mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/psychopy-users>`_.

If you want to make more substantial changes then it's often good to discuss them first on the `developers mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/psychopy-dev>`_. 

The ideal model, is to contribute via the repository on github. There is more information on that in the :ref:`developers` section of the documentation.
